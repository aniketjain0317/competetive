Paragraph:
Given an array of N integers, answer Q (i,j given as input) queries about the sum of a
subarray starting from the ith element to the jth element. (inclusive)


Input:
The first line contains 2 integers n and q.
The next line contains n elements of the array, separated by a space.
The next q lines each contain 2 integers m & n.

Constraints:
1<=n<=10^5 (n is the size of the array)
1<=q<=10^5 (q is the number of queries)
1<=a<=1000 (a is a element in the array)
0<=i<=j<=n-1 (i,j are the indexes between which the sum is required)

Output:
For each query, output a line containing the required sum
between the ith and the jth element of the array.
